# My Setup

I've been maintaining an up to date list of what hardware and software I use since I discovered [Uses This][19] a few years ago. It used to live as a page in my blog, but I like to maintain an up to date version so I can keep track of exactly what I'm using and how it changes over time.

## The hardware I use

Home - I've just bought a new desktop computer that _mostly_ consists of components that are fairly new (this is a first for me). Everything feels snappy and fast, and I love it. I also have three monitors (now identical in both size and resolution which pleases me), a [mechanical keyboard][26], a [hand-me-down gaming mouse][17], and all the docks, cables and switches to connect everything together. My personal laptops are both Thinkpads - an [x260][3] for travel and couch-surfing, and an [x230][1] which largely gets used for digitising vinyl and testing software I plan on using on one of my main computers. I also have a variety of small laptops and Raspberry Pis that fulfil various server and media functions, and a Synology NAS for backups. I'm trying to phase out a lot of my older computers and only use newer machines with SSDs and lots of memory, but it's hard to let go sometimes.

Work from home - As home, but with a [Thinkpad L13][25] doing the driving. All it requires is a couple of cable switches and toggling the input on two of my monitors. I'd love to do this without crawling under my desk, but that's a problem for another day.

Work - I've not been in my office for a while, but I think I still have something largely similar to my home setup, but with one less screen. I think I'll be taking my [very quiet solar-powered keyboard][2] in as I'll be sharing an office soon and mechanical keyboards are not conducive to good working relationships.

Travel - I don't travel right now, but which I did it would be some combination of a Thinkpad, [Raspberry Pi Zero][20], Kindle and phone. I also carry bootable USB versions of [Ubuntu][21] and [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) everywhere I go (even places I don't take a computer). Increasingly my travel hardware also includes a bike and related tools.

## The software I use

At work I’m running Windows 10. It largely does the job, but I would like to be able to live without it. Most of my day is spent doing video calls using either Teams or Zoom, but apart from those I tend to use largely the same suite of applications as I do for everything else.

At home (and whilst travelling) It’s mostly [Ubuntu][21] with a side order of [LibreElec][22] and [Raspbian][23] for my Raspberry Pis. I've been using the [i3 window manager][27] for Ubuntu since early 2020, although I do have Gnome installed on most of my computers as well and still use a lot of default Gnome software.

Firefox has always been my main browser, and it surprises me that more people don't use it.

Other software I use that I feel is somewhat noteworthy includes:

[Wordpress][24] - All my blogs run on WordPress. I currently maintain a WordPress multisite installation and several stand alone sites.

[Atom][6] - A text editor that handles Markdown well, integrates nicely with GitHub, and can preview and export to PDF. I also use [Pandoc][7] to convert to PDF, HTML and/or .docx if required (I try not to use office software until the point I have to share what I'm working on with someone else).

[Trello][9] - I use this for my to do list, and it's a good way to visualise the planning and execution of any task based work.

[Dropbox][10] - Cloud storage and syncing software to ensure I can access everything everywhere.

[IFTTT][11] and [Buffer][12] - To automate as much as possible. Between them they handle a lot of the seemingly clever things in my digital life, and explain why I seem to be able to post to social media sites at times when I appear to be elsewhere.

[Virtualbox][14] and [Multipass][8] - Because no-one needs as many physical computers as I had before virtualisation was a thing. Multipass is what I use the most at the moment, and it's really transformed the way I use containers for anything volatile or requiring increased privacy or security.

[Spotify][5] for discovering new music, and [Rhythmbox][18] for playing the music I already own.

[Github][16] for collecting together code that I've written and making the way my computers are set up available to other people in case it's useful.

## My dream setup

Maybe I'm already living the dream, but the one thing I'd really like is to go back to doing everything on one computer (ideally running Ubuntu). I also yearn to live the life of a nomad, with just a bike, a change of clothes, and a tiny laptop to my name.
