# AOTY 2023

These are the records that have been the soundtrack to my 2023. If 2022
was a bad year for the world, then 2023 was more of the same, with a
side-dose of personal horror. I did the exact same job for a whole year
for the first time in a while, but everything around me seemed more
chaotic, with ill health and general disruption not too far away. I
suspect my musical choices have been influenced by that, although it
certainly hasn't been consciously.

I'm sitting writing this on a wet and blustery evening in the Isle of
Wight (for the second year running). I think the amount of time I've
spent here over the last two years has definitely influenced some of my
choices, but only in a good way. There is some music that just makes
more sense in a rural location, and many of these records are definitely
not particularly influenced by cities or suburbia. But also this is a
list that pays a lot more homage to louder and faster music than
previous years. There are less melodically beautiful records (especially
outside the top 25), and more that channel the anger that so many people
feel towards the world and some of the people in it.
